1. Write tests for your smart contract and demonstrate
the process of testing using Hardhat Development
Environment.

ans . 

Install Hardhat:
If you haven't already, install Hardhat globally using npm:

npm install -g hardhat
Create a new project:
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

mkdir my-contract
npx hardhat init
Write Tests:
Inside the test directory of your project, create a new JavaScript file .

Run Tests:
Run your tests using the Hardhat CLI:

npx hardhat test
Hardhat will compile your contracts, deploy them to a local network,
and execute the tests. You should see the test results in your terminal.






























2) Demonstrate the steps involved in the process of
deploying your smart contract to a live network.

Make sure your smart contract code is finalized, tested, and ready for deployment.
Ensure that any constructor arguments.

Keep in mind that the process of deploying to a testnet is similar;
you would just need to configure your Hardhat network settings for 
the desired testnet and use a different network name in the deployment command.
